# Collision-Simulation
 A C++ physics simulation of the collision of two stress balls. Created for an AP Physics C project in grade 12. 

The set of simulations was first run assuming that the collision did not induce any rotational motion in the balls. The second set of simulations assumed there was rotation. The output for these simulations with a more detailed explanation can be found [here.](output.pdf)
